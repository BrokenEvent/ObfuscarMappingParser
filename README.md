# Introduction
*Obfuscar Mapping Parser* is a tool to read *Obfuscar's* Mapping.xml files and deobfuscate stacktraces created from obfuscated applications.

Just like this:

![Main purpose of the application](http://brokenevent.com/uploads/obfuscarparser/logo.png)
## Usecase
The main usecase is simple:

If you have an .NET application and used *Obfuscar* for it...

If the release obfuscated version of your application has crashed and you have a stacktrace...

If you don't afraid to use it to fix your application...

So just open Mapping.xml (generated by the *Obfuscar*) in *Obfuscar Mapping Parser* and deobfuscate your stacktrace.

## Features
* Parsing *Obfuscar* mapping files.
* Exploring and search in classes tree.
* Deobfuscation of the stacktraces.
* Analysis of items were missing in mapping and failed to deobfuscate.

## Other features
If your stacktrace is somehow broken (no parameters or results and so on), the *Obfuscar Mapping Parser* will try to substitute as much as it could. Even if obfuscated value was not added to mapping, the application will decode classname.

Another useful feature is PDB files. Microsoft Visual Studio stores there method-file mapping, so it is possible to get filename and line number for any method by its name. If you attach PDB file to *Obfuscar Mapping Parser*, it could open methods from items tree and Stacktrace analyzer in VS.
